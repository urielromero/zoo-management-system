# zoo-management-system



This project was created in Intellij IDEA using JAVA. 
See requirements PDF for details. 

The program is controlled by taking input from the user in the console. 
You are given different options to work with the system and each one is selected by entering the number assigned to it.
 
Depending on your selection, the system proceeds to ask specific questions to complete your request. 

Finally, the program gives you a summary of the requirements being tracked in the zoo. Then process is repeated until you exit the program by choosing the appropriate selection.

This is a great project to demonstrate the four pillars of object-oriented programming-in this case JAVA. These are: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and 
Polymorphism. 



-Abstraction: the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user

-Encapsulation: is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. ... Declare the variables of a class as private. Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.

-Inheritance: is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.

Polymorphism: he ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
